*** Rubik Cube Solver V1 ***

For this first version the programme will solve for each position in order, and not be optimised to skip if another position matches.
The guessing algorithm will run through possible moves till reaching a match, randomly - no optimisation in this version.

Laying the cube on the table, top left moving across, then down is 0-8
